Welcome to my tutorial for [CrispGameLib][cgl-url].

As someone who has absolutely been in love with the entirety of [ABAGames][aba-url]' (Kenta Cho) works, I eventually got around to use **CrispGameLib** in July 2021, and had probably one of my best developement experiences ever. It eventually struck me that despite library's simplicity and low barrier of entry, its popularity has been low, and I and Kenta appeared to be the only creators who used this library.

Here's my attempt to change that. If you are into making videogames and looking for something interesting, I hope I have found you one right here.
